Handle your file downloads status in a more simple and easy way :heartbeat:

  

### pubspec.yaml

```

  

## Examples


### Basic  

To start using flowder, is required to do the following setup.

```dart

final downloaderUtils = DownloaderUtils(

progressCallback: (current, total) {

final progress = (current / total) * 100;

print('Downloading: $progress');

},

file: File('$path_to_store_file/200MB.zip'),

progress: ProgressImplementation(),

onDone: () => print('Download done'),

deleteOnCancel: true,

);

final core = await Flowder.download(

'http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/200MB.zip',

downloaderUtils);

```

  

To *start* a new download.

```dart

core.download(url, downloaderUtils);

```

  
  

To *resume* a download.

```dart

core.resume();

```

  

To *cancel* a download.

```dart

core.cancel();

```

  

To *pause* a download.

```dart

core.pause();

```
